# SwiftUI-Carousel

This is a carousel view (scrollable images) implemented totally in SwiftUI, which enable some gestures includind draging, scaling, and tapping.

完全SwiftUI实现的轮播图，支持点击、放缩、滑动等手势，类似淘宝的商品图片。

Now, there are two limitations:
- When changing between the first and the last image, the animation is not beautiful as other cases.
- When tapped and changing between images, the animation is not natural.

现在还有两个地方需要优化：
- 因为实现方法的原因，普通情况下，首尾切换的动画不美观。
- 点击查看详情以后，图片之间切换的动画不够自然、顺畅。
